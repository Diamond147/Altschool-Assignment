            <p class="paragraph">
                Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology and engineering. 
                Unfortunatele, I wasn't given my desired course (Mechanical Engineering),
                which was very devastating and heart-breaking for me. Nevertheless, 
                i've always known that i will surely pursue a tech career/skill after my first 
                degree. Voila! and here i am, at Altschool Africa.
